# üß† Nerdary Challenges - Node.js Edition

This repository contains a collection of technical challenges developed during the 6-month **Nerdary** program, focused on specialization in **Node.js**. Each challenge is designed to strengthen practical skills in backend development, following best practices in coding, project structure, and scalable solutions.

## üöÄ About the Project

The purpose of this repository is to document and showcase the solutions to various challenges proposed during the program. The challenges cover topics such as:

- REST and GraphQL API design  
- In-memory data manipulation and persistence  
- File handling and export (e.g., CSV)  
- Pagination, filtering, sorting, and CRUD operations  
- Use of popular libraries in the Node.js ecosystem  
- Modular and scalable code organization  

Each challenge is encapsulated in its own folder or module to make it easy to understand, review, and run independently.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Node.js  
- Express  
- GraphQL (Apollo Server)  
- TypeScript  
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Utility libraries (fs, path, etc.)
